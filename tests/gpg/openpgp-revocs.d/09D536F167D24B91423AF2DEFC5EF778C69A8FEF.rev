This is a revocation certificate for the OpenPGP key:

pub  rsa2048/C69A8FEF 2017-11-22
      Key fingerprint = 09D5 36F1 67D2 4B91 423A  F2DE FC5E F778 C69A 8FEF
uid                  Peg Legge (This is not a real key...) <peggie@pirates.org>

A revocation certificate is a kind of "kill switch" to publicly
declare that a key shall not anymore be used.  It is not possible
to retract such a revocation certificate once it has been published.

Use it to revoke this key in case of a compromise or loss of
the secret key.  However, if the secret key is still accessible,
it is better to generate a new revocation certificate and give
a reason for the revocation.  For details see the description of
of the gpg command "--gen-revoke" in the GnuPG manual.

To avoid an accidental use of this file, a colon has been inserted
before the 5 dashes below.  Remove this colon with a text editor
before importing and publishing this revocation certificate.
