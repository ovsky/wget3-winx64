# GNU Wget2 - Introduction

GNU Wget2 is the successor of GNU Wget, a file and recursive website downloader.

Designed and written from scratch it wraps around libwget, that provides the basic
functions needed by a web client.

Wget2 works multi-threaded and uses many features to allow fast operation.

In many cases Wget2 downloads much faster than Wget1.x due to HTTP2, HTTP compression,
parallel connections and use of If-Modified-Since HTTP header.

GNU Wget2 is licensed under GPLv3+.

Libwget is licensed under LGPLv3+.

- new option --secure-protocol=PFS to have TLS only plus forcing Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
- IDN support for international domains
- autotools support
- proxy support
- cookies (session/non-session), detection of supercookies via Mozilla Public Suffix List
  (use the new option `--cookie-suffixes <filename>`, better: put it into ~/.wgetrc)

- download of single web pages / resources
- zlib/gzip compressed HTTP/HTTPS downloads (gzip, deflate)
- number of parallel download threads is adjustable
- include directive for config files (wildcards allowed)
- support for keep-alive connections
- included CSS, HTML, XML parser needed for recursive downloads
- gettext support

# Build Requirements

The following packages are needed to build the software

* autotools (autoconf, autogen, automake, autopoint, libtool)
* python (recommended for faster bootstrap)
* rsync
* tar
* makeinfo (part of texinfo)
* pkg-config >= 0.28 (recommended)
* doxygen (for creating the documentation)
* pandoc (for creating the wget2 man page)
* gettext >= 0.18.2
* libiconv (needed for IRI and IDN support)
* libz >= 1.2.3 (the distribution may call the package zlib*, eg. zlib1g on Debian)
* liblzma >= 5.1.1alpha (optional, if you want HTTP lzma decompression)
* libbz2 >= 1.0.6 (optional, if you want HTTP bzip2 decompression)
* libbrotlidec/libbrotli >= 1.0.0 (optional, if you want HTTP brotli decompression)
* libzstd >= 1.3.0 (optional, if you want HTTP zstd decompression)
* libgnutls (3.3, 3.5 or 3.6)
* libidn2 >= 0.14 (libidn >= 1.25 if you don't have libidn2)
* flex >= 2.5.35
* libpsl >= 0.5.0
* libnghttp2 >= 1.3.0 (optional, if you want HTTP/2 support)
* libmicrohttpd >= 0.9.51 (optional, if you want to run the test suite)
* lzip (optional, if you want to build distribution tarballs)
* lcov (optional, for coverage reports)
* libgpgme >= 0.4.2 (optional, for automatic signature verification)
* libpcre | libpcre2 (optional, for filtering by PCRE|PCRE2 regex)
* libhsts (optional, to support HSTS preload lists)
* libwolfssl (optional, to support WolfSSL instead of GnuTLS)

The versions are recommended, but older versions may also work.


# Downloading and building from tarball

		wget https://gnuwget.gitlab.io/wget2/wget2-latest.tar.gz
		tar xf wget2-latest.tar.gz
		cd wget2-*
		./configure
		make
		make check
		sudo make install


# Building from git

Download project and prepare sources with

		git clone https://gitlab.com/gnuwget/wget2.git
		cd wget2
		./bootstrap
		# on shell failure try 'bash ./bootstrap'

Build Wget2 with

		./configure
		make

In Haiku build Wget2 with

        setarch x86
        ./configure --prefix=/boot/home/config/non-packaged
        rm /boot/home/config/non-packaged/wget2 && mv /boot/home/config/non-packaged/wget2_noinstall /boot/home/config/non-packaged/wget2

Test the functionality

		make check

Install Wget2 and libwget

		sudo make install (or su -c "make install")
